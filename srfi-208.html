<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI provides procedures that dissect NaN (Not a Number) inexact values.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>IEEE floating-point numbers have a set of values known as NaNs,
standing for Not A Number.
They are generated by such operations as <code>(/ 0.0 0.0)</code>, the result of which
could be any number whatsoever, and by <code>(flsqrt -1.0)</code> from
SRFI 144, the result of which cannot be any number.
Scheme implementations that conform to R6RS or R7RS use the external representations
<code>+nan.0</code> and <code>-nan.0</code> for NaNs,
and the procedure <code>nan?</code> will return <code>#t</code>
when applied to any inexact real number (on R7RS systems, any inexact number)
that is a NaN.</p>

<p>In fact, however, there are 2<sup>52</sup> - 1 possible NaN values,
assuming the representation is a binary64 float.  This SRFI makes it possible
to dissect a NaN to see which of these internal representations it corresponds to.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>It is an error to call these procedures on any object that does not satisfy
both <code>nan?</code> and <code>real?</code>,
as <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html">
demons may fly out of your nose</a>.</p>

<p><code>(make-nan </code><em>negative? quiet? payload</em> [<em>float</em>]<code>)</code>
<p>Returns a NaN whose sign bit is equal to <em>negative?</em>
(<code>#t</code> for negative, <code>#f</code> for positive),
whose quiet bit is equal to <em>quiet?</em>.
(<code>#t</code> for quiet, <code>#f</code> for signaling),
and whose payload is the positive exact integer <em>payload</em>.
It is an error if <em>payload</em> is larger than a NaN can hold.
</p>
<p>If the optional argument <em>float</em> is provided,
it is an error if it is not an inexact real number.
The NaN is represented using the same number of bits
as <em>float</em>.
The default value is 0.0.
This allows Scheme implementations with multiple precisions
for inexact real numbers to generate a NaN with any
available precision.
</p>

<p><code>(nan-negative? </code><em>nan</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if the sign bit of <em>nan</em> is 1 and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(nan-quiet? </code><em>nan</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>nan</em> is a quiet NaN
based on the most significant bit of the mantissa, which is 1 for quiet NaNs
and 0 for signaling NaNs.
(A few older CPU architectures use the reverse rule.)
Quiet NaNs are passed through floating-point operations, whereas non-quiet (or signaling) NaNs
may signal a hardware exception, depending on how the CPU's floating-point instructions
have been configured.</p>
<p><code>(nan-payload </code><em>nan</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns the mantissa bits of <em>nan</em>, other than the quiet/signaling bit,
as a positive exact integer.</p>
<p><code>(nan=? </code><em>nan1 nan2</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>nan1</em> and <em>nan2</em> have the same sign, quiet bit,
and payload; and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
If <em>nan1</em> and <em>nan2</em> are of different precisions,
the lower-precision value is converted to at least the precision
of the other value.</p>
